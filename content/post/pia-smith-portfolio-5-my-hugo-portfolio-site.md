Inspired by a JAMstack article, I decided to use the Javascript, API and Markup setup for my portfolio website. I had similar thoughts years ago, because although parts of the websites are dynamic, most of it is not. Along the way, I fell in love with databases, and how everything is entered once but can be used multiple times for various computation and presentation needs. So when I read about the JAMstack, it was an easy choice.

## Getting started
I decided to put the coding in front so I initially setup my site with a simple and clear theme that could guide me in the technical set up and that I would be able to tweak later. 

### Why HUGO?
I chose Hugo out of the handful of frameworks that was recommended, because it seemed to be covering my needs best. 

I was looking for 

1. **Accessible** Documentation set up so it is easy to access with plenty of examples.

2. **Flexibile** It seemed be built for more than documentation. And had a straightforward database interaction.

## My site's setup
I started out with 

- portfolio pages
- resume page
- contact page

Then I added a bunch of different pages trying out various setups and workings with HUGO and JSON. I later decided to turn it into a 365 challenge and set that up with a new group of pages.
