First step in restructuring the Santa Cruz Library website is to find a way to set up a way to set up a view that I would be able to resize from the width of a cell phone to the width of a laptop. Most mobile phones have a device-width of 480px or lower, iPhone 4 320px.

#### solution: 
I decided to go with css resize and to to make the layout responsive, I used marcj's css-element-queries on GitHub. 

Next I started copying over the homepage for Santa Cruz Public Libraries.


In order to make it work, using the the div width and save my self some time setting it up I used SASS and pasted W3 styles in the relevant widths, however the div-width doesn't work with max- width, so I had to adjust the navigation so it shows and hides depending on min-width.
