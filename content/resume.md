**Pia Smith ( [pia@piasmith.com](/contact/) )** looking for frontend development job where / with 

**Skills**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, APIs, JAM, Hugo, D3

**Strengths**: Thrive with steep and constant learning curves. Put the customer, internal or external, first. Work from "the why" and will align work to that, including questioning solutions.

**Areas of interest**: Making the world a better place one website at a time through data. 

For me, software is this great intersection of creativity and problem solving.   We have an idea of something we want to build, and some tools to help us.  Along the way we learn new things, find problems to be solved and in the end have something really amazing that was only possible because of a lot of really smart and creative people working together.
